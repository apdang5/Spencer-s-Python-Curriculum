    "\n",
    "The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API) isn't that insightful, but an api is a way to directly querry a webserver and (in our case) ask for data. An api provides several advantages\n",
    "1. You only download the data you need\n",
    "2. You do not need to distribute data files with your code\n",
    "3. You have access to the 'freshest data'\n",
