As computers developed, many different groups created many different encodings (e.g., ASCII), so the letter 'K' may translate to 0010 in one encoding and 00100101 in another. What a mess. \n",

(Now is not the time for a discussion of the bureaucratic nightmares of large international organizations, but this is a nice example.) \n",
