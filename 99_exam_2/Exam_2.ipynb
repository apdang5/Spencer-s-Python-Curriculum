NAFTA is renegotiated, the state of trade with China is in flux, and the U.S.-E.U. trade relationship is strained. How would decreased access to foreign markets affect local economies? States that are net exporters would lose revenues and states that are net importers would lose a source of consumer goods and inputs into local industry. How exposed are states to foreign trade?\n",

Finally, the folder cb_2017_us_state_500k.zip contains the shapefiles for all U.S. states (you will need to unzip it for this exercise).\n",
